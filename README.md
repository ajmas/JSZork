# JSZork

ZorK I originally recreated by [Nate Tryon](https://github.com/PotterOtherP),
and parked as of 27 October 2020.

## Changes from the Original

The project has since been further developped, such that it can be run with
different frontends, such as a browser, CLI, in Discord and others.

To support the above to the project has been converted to use modules.

## Running the Project in a Browser

Since many browsers will generate a CORS exception when loading from file
we need to run this from an HTTP server. For this we will provide one,
so start off by ensuring you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed,
then:

  - Install dependencies: `npm install`
  - Launch the http-server: `npm run dev`
  - Open the web page at: http://localhost:80801/zork.html


Note: at this time the project is still a work in progress, so treat it as
broken for now.
